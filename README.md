# altschool-sql-project-helper-guide
💡 A beginner friendly survival guide to passing the AltSchool SQL project, step-by-step fixes, prettytable explanations, assertion error solutions, and more.

# 🧰 AltSchool SQL Project Helper Kit

🚀 **Welcome, SQL Warrior!**
This repo is your *survival kit* for completing the AltSchool Tinyuka 2nd semester SQL data analysis project without losing your mind. If you’re tired of “AssertionError” haunting you like a ghost and wondering why your code *looks right* but still fails, you're in the right place.

I built this after submitting mine, facing a wild ride through:

* Kernel restarts 🌀
* Package bugs 😵

Now I’ve wrapped it all up into one clean, beginner-proof repo, built so that **anyone can replicate the project** from start to finish without asking for help.

## 🎯 Goals

* Help you avoid common mistakes I faced
* Make your submission pass on the first try
* Explain *why* errors happen, not just what to do
* Boost your GitHub with a clean, replicable project

---

## 💡 Tech Stack

* SQLite3
* ipython-sql
* PrettyTable (used under the hood for validation)
* Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda)

---

## 🌱 Why I Created This

This is more than a helper guide, it’s a **portfolio flex** and proof that I can:

* Solve real-world beginner pain points
* Document technical fixes clearly
* Build teaching assets from my own struggle

You can steal my queries, sure. But more importantly, I want you to understand *why* they work, so you can debug confidently in the future.
